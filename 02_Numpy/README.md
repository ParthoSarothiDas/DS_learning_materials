# DS_learning_materials

A curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting my journey in learning Data Science.  
This repository focuses on foundational concepts in **Statistics**, **Python**, and **NumPy**, with practical, beginner-friendly implementations and explanations.

These notebooks serve both as my **personal learning references** and as **open resources** for anyone interested in building a strong foundation in data science.
