#  Exploratory Data Analysis on Red Wine Quality Dataset

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Red Wine Quality dataset**, which includes physicochemical measurements and quality scores of red wines. The dataset helps identify the characteristics that influence wine quality and consumer preferences.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **1,359 red wine samples**, each described by **11 numerical features** related to chemical properties and **1 target variable** (`quality`), which is an integer score between 3 and 8.

### Features and Unique Values:
| Feature                 | Unique Values |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| fixed acidity           | 96             |
| volatile acidity        | 143            |
| citric acid             | 80             |
| residual sugar          | 91             |
| chlorides               | 153            |
| free sulfur dioxide     | 60             |
| total sulfur dioxide    | 144            |
| density                 | 436            |
| pH                      | 89             |
| sulphates               | 96             |
| alcohol                 | 65             |
| quality (target)        | 6              |


##  Basic Information

- **Total Samples**: 1,359
- **Total Features**: 12
- **Missing Values**: None
- **Data Type Summary**:
  

##  EDA Objectives

- Understand dataset structure and variable distributions
- Explore patterns and relationships between chemical features and quality
- Detect and visualize outliers
- Identify the most influential factors affecting wine quality

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Key Analyses Performed

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary of each variable (mean, std, min, max)
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Verified dataset completeness
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and boxplots for each feature
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmap to examine linear relationships
- **Feature vs. Quality**: Visual inspection of how each feature relates to wine quality using bar plots, line plots, and group-by statistics


##  Key Insights

- No missing values were found in the dataset
- Wines with higher alcohol and sulphates tend to score better in quality
- Most wines are rated between 5 and 6
- Some variables like `volatile acidity` and `density` show inverse trends with wine quality
- Several features have a high number of unique values, suitable for continuous variable analysis
