# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the classic **Iris dataset**, which is widely used for pattern recognition and classification problems. The dataset is loaded using the `seaborn` library's built-in function.

##  Dataset Description

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species:  
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample includes the following features:
- `sepal_length` (in cm)
- `sepal_width` (in cm)
- `petal_length` (in cm)
- `petal_width` (in cm)
- `species` (class/label)

## EDA Objectives

- Understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset  
- Identify and visualize patterns, relationships, and distributions  
- Detect any missing values or outliers  
- Compare the features across species  

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

- **Data overview:** Shape, data types, null values, basic statistics
- **Pairplot:** Visualize pairwise relationships between features
- **Boxplots:** Understand feature distribution and identify outliers
- **Violin plots:** Visualize distribution and kernel density
- **Heatmap:** Show correlation between features


##  Conclusions

- No missing values were found in the dataset
- The species are linearly separable in some feature combinations (e.g., petal length vs. width)
- Petal measurements are more informative than sepal measurements for distinguishing between species
