# K-Means Clustering

This folder contains study materials, code examples, and a project on **K-Means Clustering**, one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.  

It is organized as part of my learning journey under `07_Machine_Learning_Basics` in the `DS_learning_materials` repository.
