# PCA_model

This folder is a part of my Machine Learning Models learning journey and focuses on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It includes theoretical insights, mathematical foundations, and practical implementations of PCA.

## Contents

- Step-by-step implementation of PCA from scratch  
- Explanation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and their roles in PCA  
- Application of PCA using Scikit-learn  
- Visualizations to understand PCA components and transformations  

## Datasets Used

- **Iris dataset** (from Scikit-learn)  
- **Wine Quality dataset** (CSV format)

## Files to be Included

- `1_PCA_Intuition_Mathematics.pdf` – Notes covering PCA theory and math  
- `2_Intuition_PCA.ipynb` – PCA implementation and visualization on Iris dataset  
- `3_PCA_real_data.ipynb` – PCA application on real-world data (Wine Quality dataset)  
- Dataset files (as required by the notebooks)
