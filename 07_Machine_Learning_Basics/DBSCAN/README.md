# DBSCAN Clustering â€“ Density-Based Clustering in Action

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks and learning materials to understand and apply **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**, a powerful unsupervised clustering algorithm used in data science and machine learning.

The materials include comparisons with **K-Means**, practical applications, and real-world dataset usage â€” written as part of my data science learning journey and shared for the benefit of fellow learners.

## Purpose

This repository is part of my continuous learning in machine learning and clustering techniques.
It is intended to serve both as a **learning reference for myself** and a **free educational resource** for others interested in unsupervised learning.
