# Seaborn Important Graphs

This Jupyter Notebook is part of my ongoing journey in learning data visualization for data science. It covers a collection of essential graphs using **Seaborn**, a powerful Python library built on top of Matplotlib.

## About the Notebook

The purpose of this notebook is to serve as a **reference guide** for creating various insightful and visually appealing plots using Seaborn. It includes practical code examples that demonstrate how to use Seaborn’s built-in themes and functionality for enhanced statistical visualizations.

### Topics Covered

- Introduction to Seaborn and dataset loading
- Distribution plots
  - `distplot`, `histplot`, `kdeplot`
- Categorical plots
  - `boxplot`, `violinplot`, `stripplot`, `swarmplot`
- Relationship plots
  - `scatterplot`, `lineplot`
- Matrix plots
  - `heatmap`
- Plot styling and themes
- Plot customization with titles, labels, and legends

### File Included

- `2. Seaborn_important_graphs.ipynb` — Contains all the code and explanation for each plot type.

## Purpose

This notebook was created to be a **quick reference tool** for myself and other learners who want to understand and utilize Seaborn's capabilities for statistical and exploratory data analysis. It is beginner-friendly and includes comments for easy understanding.


## Learning Journey

This notebook is another step in my goal to become a data scientist. It complements my learning by building a hands-on library of visualization techniques. Suggestions, forks, or improvements are always welcome!
